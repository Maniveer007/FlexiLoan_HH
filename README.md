# Project Title: FLEXILOAN

## Overview

In traditional DeFi protocols like Aave, when users provide liquidity to the flash loan pool, their assets are staked and represented by receipt tokens. However, these staked assets remain locked, limiting their usability. Users effectively hold tokens in a pool, unable to fully leverage their value or liquidity potential. Our project, the **Non-Locking FLEXILOAN Protocol**, introduces a novel solution using a reactive network to address these limitations and enhance asset liquidity.

## Unique Features of the FLEXILOAN Protocol

- **Token Ownership Retained by Users**: In our protocol, users retain full ownership of their tokens while still participating as liquidity providers for flash loans. Instead of transferring tokens to a central pool, users hold their assets directly, enabling full access and control over their funds.

- **Instant Liquidity Management**: In our system, users become liquidity providers by simply approving the flash loan contract. When a userâ€™s approval event is detected, our protocol automatically updates the liquidity pool details. If the user transfers assets, the protocol instantly reflects these changes, making the liquidity dynamic and responsive.

- **Fee Structure**: For each flash loan transaction, a fee of **0.05%** is applied. This fee is distributed among liquidity providers, ensuring a continuous incentive while maintaining the non-locking nature of the protocol.

- **Unmatched Asset Accessibility**: Users maintain full access to their assets, as there is no asset lock-up in the liquidity pool. This structure empowers liquidity providers, enabling them to freely move, trade, or leverage their tokens across other DeFi protocols while still participating in the flash loan ecosystem.
